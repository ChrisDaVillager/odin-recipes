# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!

I will be demonstrating everything I have learned so far.
As I make changes, I will be practicing committing changes often 
and pushing to GitHub.

Changes made so far: Added text to README, created images and recipes directories, added format to the index. Added relative links to index.html and breakfast.html so user could bounce back and forth between the pages. Always make sure, when trying to link from one directory to parent directory, to use ../ .  

After creating the index.html and the first recipe, I was beginning to feel comfortable writing up the boilerplate and setting up the webpages for the second and third recipes. The biggest takeaway from this project is how precise one needs to be when setting up the parent directory and when you would like to add images. Once that was able to click in my head, it made everything a lot easier. Looking forward for any feedback and future projects with T.O.P!
