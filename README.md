# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!

I will be demonstrating everything I have learned so far.
As I make changes, I will be practicing committing changes often 
and pushing to GitHub.

Changes made so far: Added text to README, created images and recipes directories, added format to the index. Added relative links to index.html and breakfast.html so user could bounce back and forth between the pages. Always make sure, when trying to link from one directory to parent directory, to use ../ .

Completed the first two recipes for the project. Will return tomorrow to complete project in it's entirety.
